# Task List - AudioVisualizer Phase 2 (Enhancements)

## 1. Color System Improvements
- [ ] Implement color based on amplitude in `TerminalVisualizer`.
- [ ] Respect color profile `type` (solid, frequency, amplitude) in `TerminalVisualizer`.
- [ ] Sync color profiles to Browser frontend.
- [ ] Implement color profiles in Browser frontend (Canvas rendering).

## 2. Audio Processing Enhancements
- [ ] Implement a more robust "Modulation" system (Carrier frequency adjustment, etc.).
- [ ] Improve Pitch Shifting (maybe basic Phase Vocoder if possible, or just better interpolation).
- [ ] Add "Stereo" support (currently it seems to be mono-mixed).

## 3. UI/UX Improvements
- [ ] Add more info to the Terminal Settings Menu.
- [ ] Improve Browser UI (better sliders, color profile selector).
- [ ] Add a "File Selector" for the browser if in file mode.

## 4. Documentation & Maintenance
- [ ] Update README.md with current features and instructions.
- [ ] Add more comprehensive tests for audio transformations.
